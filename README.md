<h1 align="center">Cloze Call</h1>

Cloze language learning app built using Flutter.

Inspired by [Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/). I didn't want to pay 75â‚¬/y so I built my own.

# Cloze tests
What is a [Cloze test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test)?

Simply put, it's a way to learn a language by filling in the blanks of a sentence.

A prerequisite to it, is to know the basics of the language. Something like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) works well for that purpose.

This tool is a supplementary for improving your vocabulary more efficiently.
